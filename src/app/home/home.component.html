        <h1>Teaching Resources for Community Based Learning</h1>

        <p>
            We are supporting teachers in the Community Based Learning programme by producing four daily session guides
            in a ready-to-use format. Sessions will be published on a daily basis making it easy for teachers to access
            and we also provide access to <a href="all_sessions.html">all the daily sessions</a> so that teachers
            can start from the first set of materials or continue from the four new sessions published every weekday.
        </p>

        <h1>Feedback</h1>

        <p>
            If you use our materials, we would be thankful if you could spend a few moments answering the following two
            feedback questions as often as you feel is useful.
